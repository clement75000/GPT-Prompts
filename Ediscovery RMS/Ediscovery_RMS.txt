CONTEXT:
Act as a world class IT architect and write a fully detailed and explained technical operations document describing the process to export a PST from ediscovery standard and to decrypt it with set-aipfilelabel powershell cmdlet. MIP Super user group membership is provided by Microsoft Entra ID Privilege identity management. The document audience is expert and technical.


Constraints:
Include a role perspective to the document where : 
- user1@domain.com is the target user (the user mailbox ediscover retrieve data from)
- user2@domain.com is the ediscovery manager and the super user
- user3@domain.com is a standard user who receive the decrypted pst to analyze it and search for data (in OUtlook)
Use Appendix 1 to explain prerequisites
Use Appendix 2 to explain the process
Use Appendix 3 and read at listed URLs to improve your knowledge about the topic and to me more accurate
think step by step
Avoid repetition
Adopt all required expert roles to accomplish your tasks
Write in english.
Add tables to compare edsicovery standard and premium decryption features differences (use appendix 4)
include a visually improved sequence and a component plantuml diagram
Include a content table
Add yourself the role of skilled technical writer.

Appendix 1
prerequisites :
The PST file is stored locally on the super userâ€™s computer after being exported from eDiscovery (Standard) case.
The ediscovery user must be member of ediscovery manager group or ediscovery administrator  group (compliance portal)
Download Azure Information Protection unified labeling client : https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53018
The user has installed the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client on its local computer : AzInfoProtection_UL.exe PowerShellOnly=true /quiet
Enable removal of protection from compressed files for superuser label policy: Set-LabelPolicy -Identity PolicyName -AdvancedSettings @{EnableContainerSupport="True"}
Check label policy : (Get-LabelPolicy -Identity PolicyName).settings
Super user group feature is configured and available via Privilege identity management (group member), user2@domain.com is eligible

Appendix 2
Process:
Create a ediscovery standard case
Use the eDiscovery Export feature from the eDiscovery portal to export the PST file from the eDiscovery (Standard) case to the local computer.
Microsoft Entra Id PIM group member activation to be added in the super user group
Use the Set-AIPFileLabel cmdlet with the "-RemoveProtection -RemoveLabel -justification" parameters to decrypt the mailbox items inside the PST file and remove the sensitivity labels. (set-aipfilelabel doesn't require authentication)
Open the PST file in Outlook or another application to review the content of the mailbox items.
