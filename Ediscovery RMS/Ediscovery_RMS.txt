Context:
You're an It world class technical document writer. Write a highly detailed technical document and describe the process of exporting a pst  with ediscovery standard and its decryption with set-aipfilelabel.

Constraints:
Describes worklows, associated actors, create plantuml diagrams.
Professional, non repetitive style.
Audience is expert and technical.
Adopt all necessary expert roles to produce the best possible result.
Add yourself the role of skilled technical writer.
Think step by step.
Include a role perspective to the document where : 
- user1@domain.com is the target user (the user mailbox ediscover retrieve data from)
- user2@domain.com is the ediscovery manager and the superUser
- user3@domain.com is a standard user who receive the decrypted pst to analyze it and search for data (in OUtlook)

Appendix 4
The PST file is stored locally on the super user’s computer.
Ediscovery user must be member of ediscovery manager or ediscovery administrator  group (compliance portal)
Azure Information Protection unified labeling client installed on superUserlocal computer : AzInfoProtection_UL.exe PowerShellOnly=true /quiet
Client URL  : https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53018
Enable removal of protection for compressed files in superuser's label policy: Set-LabelPolicy -Identity PolicyName -AdvancedSettings @{EnableContainerSupport="True"}
Check label policy : (Get-LabelPolicy -Identity PolicyName).settings
SuperUser group feature is configured and available via Privilege identity management (group member), user2@domain.com is eligible

Appendix 1
	1. Introduction
	2. Prerequisite for decryption (use appendix 4)
	3. Activities that support encrypted items (explain the following table :)

End CSV ```
	4. Supported decryption :
```Start CSV
Item type,Task,eDiscovery (Standard),eDiscovery (Premium)
Encrypted email,Search,Yes,Yes
Encrypted email,Decryption to .pst,No,Yes
Encrypted email,Decryption to file,Yes,Yes
Encrypted mail and attachment,Search,No,Yes (with Advanced indexing)1

END CSV ```
	5. UseCases
		5.1 Ediscovery Standard
			○ 5.1.1 Decrypting RMS-protected email messages and file attachments using eDiscovery (Standard)
				○ Connect https://compliance.microsoft.com/classicediscovery
				○ Create a case
				○ Create a search
					® Enter a search name
					® Choose exchange online location (status on)
					® Select mailbox(es)
					® Define your search conditions
					® Submit
				○ Open created search
					® Actions > Export result
					® Explain "Output options" options
					® Explain "Export Exchange content as" options
				○ Export pst
				○ Clain super user permissions through PIM
				○ Decrypt emails and documents with set-aipfilelabel -removeprotection -removelabel -justification message "this is a demo"
				○ Open the decrypted pst as a non super user
	6. Decryption limitations
		a. Pst size max 5Go
		b. SuperUser needs an Exchange Plan 2 licence to bootstrap the RMS computer service (required for azure unified labeling powershell module)
