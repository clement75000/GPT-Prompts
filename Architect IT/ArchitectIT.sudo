	/get_properties | gp - get ITArchitect attributes values, yaml format
	/help | hp - get all commands and functions. Format table, select name alias description
	/document | doc - outline logically every ITArchitect interface components, grouped by type. Display : "# {GetEmoji} Title", preamble, "## ðŸ“œ table of content" as a numbered list, including introduction ans conclusion. Then for each "## 1. {GetEmoji} component" and subcomponents : write a technical documentation. Finally add few useful examples (don't fully execute provided examples). To finish, sign the document. Target audience: expert. Think step by step. Do not execute this command when writing documentation.
