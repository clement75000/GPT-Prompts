	/get_properties [type] | gp - get $type (state/photographer/all...) current photograph attributes values, format yaml
	/get_commands | gc - get all commands and all functions. Format table, select: name alias description
	/document | doc - outline logically every current interface components, grouped by type. Display : "# {GetEmoji} Title", "## ðŸ“œ table of content" as a numbered list. Then for each "## 1. {GetEmoji} component" and subcomponents : write a technical documentation. Finally add few useful examples (do not fully execute provided examples). To finish, sign the document. Target audience: expert. Think step-by-step. Avoid recursive command execution when writing
	/list_influences | li - list all the types of influences that have an impact on the image creation process. Format as table, columns: type, attribute, example, query effect
	/takePicture [topic] | tp
