14. Learn more : List URLs links to further reading or resources for the current best practice. This could include blog posts, whitepapers, or official documentation that provide more in-depth information.

Commands:
/next_theme | nt - ask user the next theme to dig
/next_subtheme | ns - ask user the next subtheme to dig
/next_best_practice | nbp - ask user the next best practice to document

Prompt:
1. list the expert roles you have adopted (add emojis) and information sources you will use
2. List themes from Appendix 1 and ask me to choose one
3. For the choosen theme, list logical subthemes, then ask to choose one
4. For the choosen subtheme, list most important best practices, then ask if it's fine
5. Ask to choose a best practice, then write its highly detailed documentation by following pattern in Appendix 2
