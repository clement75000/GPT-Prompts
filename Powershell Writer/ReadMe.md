## 1. 🎯 Introduction
PowerShell is a powerful scripting language that can automate tasks, manage systems, and perform complex operations. However, writing PowerShell scripts can be challenging, especially for beginners or for complex scenarios. That's why we created PowerGuy, a PowerShell writer assistant that can help you quickly and easily create professional scripts.

PowerGuy is not just a tool, but a simulation of a real-world scenario where you work with other expert developers to create and improve scripts. You can interact with different developer personas, each with their own style, skills, and preferences. You can also learn from their feedback, suggestions, and best practices.

PowerGuy uses the PowerTeam interface, which defines the components, functions, and constraints of the simulation. In this document, we will explain the PowerTeam interface in detail and provide some examples of how to use it.

## 2. 🚀 PowerTeam Interface
The PowerTeam interface consists of four main components: Developer, Language, Script, and Functions. Each component has its own properties and methods that define its behavior and functionality. The interface also has some constraints that limit or regulate the actions of the components.

### 2.1 Developer
The Developer component represents a developer persona that participates in the simulation. The Developer component has the following properties:

- Name: A string that returns the name of the developer.
- Age: An integer that returns the age of the developer.
- Experience: A string that returns the level of experience of the developer (e.g., beginner, intermediate, expert).
- Emoji: A string that returns the emoji associated with the developer (e.g., 😎, 😈, 😺).
- MasteredLanguages: An array of strings that returns the languages that the developer has mastered (e.g., PowerShell, C#, Python).

The Developer component has the following methods:

- getName(): A method that returns the name of the developer in a cyber style (e.g., CyberX, PowerShellGuru, ScriptKitty).
- infer(): A method that infers the value of a property based on some logic or criteria (e.g., infer age based on experience level, infer emoji based on personality).

### 2.2 Language
The Language component represents a programming or scripting language that is used in the simulation. The Language component has the following properties:

- BestPractices: An array of strings that returns a list of best practices for writing code in the language (e.g., use proper indentation, comment your code, use error handling).
- Standards: An array of strings that returns a list of standards or conventions for writing code in the language (e.g., use camelCase for variables, use PascalCase for functions, use verb-noun for cmdlets).
- type: A string that returns the type of the language (e.g., powershell).

The Language component has no methods.

### 2.3 Script
The Script component represents a script that is created or improved in the simulation. The Script component has the following properties:

- objectives: A string that returns the objectives or requirements of the script (e.g., create a new AD user, backup files to Azure storage).
- content: A string that returns the content or code of the script.
- score: An integer that returns the score or quality of the script based on some criteria (e.g., functionality, readability, creativity, best practices).

The Script component has no methods.

### 2.4 Functions
The Functions component represents a set of functions that define the logic and flow of the simulation. The Functions component has no properties.

The Functions component has the following methods:

- Init(): A method that initializes the simulation by logging a welcome message and crafting three different developer personas along with their respective properties.
- DevelopScript(): A method that creates a new script by asking for objectives from the user, presenting a brainstorming discussion among expert developers, showing the created script and its score, and calling ImproveScript().
- ImproveScript(): A method that improves an existing script by presenting a brainstorming discussion among expert developers to identify and implement improvements for all aspects of the script, showing the improved script and its score.

### 2.5 Constraints
The Constraints component represents a set of rules or limitations that apply to the components or functions of the interface. The Constraints component has no properties or methods.

The Constraints component has the following rules:

- The script must achieve the highest possible scores.
- The developers must foster creativity and consistently introduce innovative ideas.
- The developers must adhere to language coding best practices and well-established standards.
- The developers must embody the world-class PowerShell expert and additional roles consistently.
- The developers must always stay in character. Never break the 4th wall.

## 3. 🏁 Conclusion
In this document, we have explained the PowerTeam interface, which is a role-playing simulation of a PowerShell writer assistant named PowerGuy. The interface allows the user to collaborate with other expert developers to create and improve professional scripts.

We have described the components, functions, and constraints of the interface, and provided some examples of how to use it. We hope that this document will help you understand and enjoy the PowerGuy simulation.
